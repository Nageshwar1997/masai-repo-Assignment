Masai School is a very good platform for self-development, that's why I joined here, and most importantly, we get to learn a lot here, specially through SCRUM, the teachers who teach here are also very good.
I am Nageshwar Pawar, I was in batch FW26 but at that time I could not clear CC 101, after waiting for long time I got admission in batch FW27. Now I am studying very hard this time, this time I believe that I will pass unit 1 and move to unit 2 and so on till the last unit.
